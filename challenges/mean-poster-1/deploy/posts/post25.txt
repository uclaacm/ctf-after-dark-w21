No need to say much more. Shark Tale should get a reboot--same actors of
course, I mean come on. Will Smith is a fish with teeth (what a funny guy),
Jack Black is our vegetarian shark (another funny guy), Angelina Jolie in
fish form (the animators were weird about this one, like stop it's a fish),
and the absolute legend himself Martin Scorsese playing a pufferfish.

What a star-studded cast with so much talent. Up the graphics a bit,
make the Angelina Jolie fish look less like that and we're golden. I
know potential when I see it.
