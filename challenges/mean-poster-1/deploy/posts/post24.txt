SOMEONE SPOILED STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE SO I NEED TO
BRING THIS TO ATTENTION >:'O i'm sorry i WENT ON THE REDDIT BECAUSE
I WAS INTERESTED IN THE FANDOM. i wanted to experience the reveal for MYSELF. 

how was i supposed to know that kiera knightley AND natalie portman
were in this movie????so ok, yeah *everyone* has watched star wars
so of course something was gonna be spoiled but this is crossing a
line. don't spoil the phantom menace fr people new to the fandom >:(
we deserve the same experience of discovering that natalie portman
is actually queen amidala. 

if anyone asks, this spoiler brought my rating of the phantom menace
from 10/10 to 3/10. thanks a lot.
