I need to get better at Fortnite to impress my friends. I feel 
like I'm not living up to my namesake. I spent so much money to
look like Iron Man so why am I getting beaten by some pleb using
the default skin? I mean WHAT'S THE POINT OF BUYING THE SKIN IF IT 
DOESN'T MAKE YOU BETTER I SPENT SO MUCH OF MY MOM'S MONEY
