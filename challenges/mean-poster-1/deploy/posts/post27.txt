i mean, i don't really care but i totally forgot ryan seacrest existed.
like this man's voice has been heard by so many people (not like
that was a good thing) but i don't even know what he looks like. did
he really disappear if i can't even put a face to his name. 

how is he even a celebrity. is he a celebrity? ryan seacrest doesn't
even sound like a real name. he's probably fake tbh, like the government ya know.
