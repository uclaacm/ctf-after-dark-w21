I have a weird bug on the Spotify client that has so
far happened on AndroidTV and on Windows.

Every once in a while, the music in my queue will stop,
and it will be replaced by an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast
(and about 6 more episodes where my music queue used to be).
It is always the same episodes in the same order.

I do not listen to Joe Rogan. I have never listened to Joe Rogan.
I might listen to Joe Rogan in the future, but I'd prefer to be
able to select the time and the place.

I found a few other mentions of this bug on the Spotify forums
but no one has ever posted a solution or acknowledgment. Has
this happened to you? Is anywhere safe from Joe?

Please respond.
