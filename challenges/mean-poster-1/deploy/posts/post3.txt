No, you’re NOT a real gamer.

I’m so sick of all these people that tho k they’re gamers. No, you’re not.
Most of you are not even close to being gamers. I see these people saying
“I put well over 100 hours in this game, it’s great!” that’s nothing, most
of us can easily put 300+ hours in all our games. I see people who only have
a Nintendo Switch and claim to be gamers. Come talk to me when you pick up a
PS4 controller then we be friends.

Sincerely, all of the ACTUAL gamers.
